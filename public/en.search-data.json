The project ideas and results enabled one NHMRC Ideas Grant ($2.5M), an MRFF Genomics Health Futures Mission ($1M), and a current 2024 MRFF Early to Mid-Career Researchers bid ($5M) led by the Garvan Institute. Developed novel approaches to improve ancient DNA research methods, and standards and conducted systematic benchmarks.

Here’s the list:","211-zoxide#2.1.1 Zoxide":"Zoxide instead of cd: a modern take on cd that can navigate to previously visited directories (folders) using fuzzy matching, has a shortcut/bookmark function, and just makes navigating around the file system a breeze.

We're pleased to share new research published in *iScience*, led by [Xavier Roca-Rada](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/xavier.roca-rada) in collaboration with Daniel R. Cuesta-Aguirre, Diana C. Vinueza-Espinosa, Roberta Davidson, Shyamsundar Ravishankar, and others. This study reveals fascinating insights into genetic transitions across prehistoric Iberia through ancient DNA analysis from the Mas d'en Boixos archaeological site in Northeastern Spain.

The research demonstrates remarkable genetic continuity and change spanning from the Middle Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age, uncovering evidence of family relationships, ancestral origins, and social structures of these ancient populations.

## Abstract

Mas d'en Boixos is a key prehistoric site in Northeastern Iberia spanning from the Early Neolithic to the Late Iron Age. We analyzed genome-wide data from eight individuals and ten mitogenomes, dated to the Middle Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, alongside three previously published Iron Age individuals. Two Middle Neolithic individuals buried together were first-degree maternal relatives and carried Western Hunter-Gatherer, Anatolian, and residual Magdalenian-associated ancestries. Conversely, six Early Bronze Age individuals buried in a hypogeum exhibited distinct mitochondrial lineages. Among them, three were third-degree relatives, and all males shared a Y-chromosome lineage, consistent with a collective burial of an extended family within a patrilocal society practicing possible female exogamy. These individuals showed genetic continuity with additional Steppe-related ancestry, which displayed a subtle southward gradient across Iberia. We also identified an Eastern European mitochondrial lineage—challenging the proposed male-driven Bronze Age transition—and Mediterranean gene flow—suggesting dynamic interactions across the sea.

## Key Findings

- **Neolithic Family Relationships**: Two Middle Neolithic individuals were first-degree maternal relatives carrying mixed Western Hunter-Gatherer, Anatolian, and residual Magdalenian-associated ancestries
- **Bronze Age Social Structure**: Evidence of patrilocal society with possible female exogamy in Early Bronze Age populations
- **Steppe Ancestry Gradient**: Subtle southward gradient of Steppe-related ancestry across Iberia
- **Challenging Assumptions**: Identification of Eastern European mitochondrial lineage challenges the proposed male-driven Bronze Age transition
- **Mediterranean Connections**: Evidence of dynamic Bronze Age interactions across the Mediterranean Sea

## Significance

This study provides critical insights into the genetic and social transitions that shaped prehistoric Iberian populations. The evidence for patrilocal family structures, female exogamy, and complex migration patterns helps us better understand how ancient societies were organized and how different populations interacted during the Neolithic and Bronze Age.

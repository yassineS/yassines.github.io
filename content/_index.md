My name is Yassine Souilmi, PhD., MS. I am a Fulbright alumnus and an accomplished research scientist. I have made significant contributions to the fields of bioinformatics, evolutionary genomics, evolutionary medicine, and genomics with peer-reviewed publications in the top specialised bioinformatics journals and multidisciplinary research targeting a broader audience, with my contributions appearing in high-profile journals such as Nature Ecology and Evolutions, Current Biology, Science, the Lancet, and PNAS. I contributed to the earliest efforts (since 2012) to deploy genomic analysis workloads on complicated cloud computing infrastructure.

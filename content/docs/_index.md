This is a random collection of knowledge that I gather for myself, and that you might find useful. Some of it is related to Data Science, Genomics, and Bioinformatics, and some of it is related to my interest in technology, software and general tinkering with tools, home automation, home labs, and other random topics that you may find useful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I use and test all the stuff that I write about, but I cannot guarentee it will continue to work as described or that it will not require tinkering on your part to fit your system and needs.

## Teaching
### 2020-2022: Graph Pangenomes, BIONF3010 & BIONF7150, The University of Adelaide, Australia
- Covering theoretical and practical concepts of graph-pangenomes, a cutting-edge technology pegged to be the next iteration of the human reference genome by the Human Genome Reference Consortium.
- Staggered post-graduate and undergraduate courses.

### 2023-2024: Population Genomics, BIONF3010 & BIONF7150, The University of Adelaide, Australia
- Teaching key concepts behind the population genomics field and practical examples in population history and dynamics reconstruction.
- Staggered post-graduate and undergraduate courses.

### 2024: Ancient DNA, BIOINF3000 & BIOTECH7005, The University of Adelaide, Australia
- Introducing the ancient DNA field and applications to students teaching key concepts behind the population genomics field and practical examples in population history and dynamics reconstruction.
- Staggered post-graduate and undergraduate courses.

### 2014-2015: High-throughput Sequencing at Harvard Medical School, BMI714, Harvard University, USA
- Covering the key steps to sequencing DNA or RNA data from experimental design to medical discovery or diagnosis.
- I supported the primary instructors in preparing and updating their teaching material, provided support for the students, as well as co-designed and taught the practicums.
- Post-graduate course.

### 2013-2014: Introduction to Programming and Bioinformatics, MO2, Mohammed Vth University, Morocco
- In this course, I was the primary instructor and provided the students with an introduction to programming, bash, and key concepts in bioinformatics, including practical skills in data generation, quality control, and processing.
- Post-graduate course.

## Mentorship and Supervision
- Supervising three PhD candidates, one as primary supervisor (awaiting commencement date).
- Supervised four PhDs to completion, three graduated with high distinctions and deanâ€™s commendation.
- Supervised one master's student to completion with high distinction.
- Supervised one honours student who completed with high distinction.
- Regularly supervise undergraduate placements. 

## Workshops and Training
Since 2012, I have co-organised over 25 face-to-face bioinformatics, genomics, and population genomics workshops in North America (Harvard Medical School), Africa (Pan-African Bioinformatics Network-H3AbioNet, H3Africa), Australia (e.g. Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, Black Ochre Data Labs), and Asia (Indonesia and China). I contributed to the organisation and coordination of an additional 20 online seminars.

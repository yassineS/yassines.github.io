### 2022-current: NHMRC Grant-Funded Researcher B, The University of Adelaide 
- Group Leader, genomics and bioinformatics, Australian Centre for Ancient DNA.
- Evolutionary Medicine research fellow at the Black Ochre Data Labs, a joint initiative between the Kids Research Institute in Perth and the Australian National University.
- Using the largest cohort of Indigenous genomes in Australia, I am leading an international research team characterising the genetic determinants of Type 2 Diabetes in Aboriginal South Australians.

### 2019-2022: ARC Grant-Funded Researcher (A), The University of Adelaide
- Worked in collaboration with the National Centre for Indigenous Genomics (NCIG) to build a draft reference pangenome that integrates whole-genome assemblies built from long-read sequencing and variation data representative of the unique Australian genetic diversity, in a graph-based representation.
- Developed a working relationship with the Human Genome Reference, the Human Pangenome Reference, and the Telomere-to-Telomere consortia.
- The project ideas and results enabled one NHMRC Ideas Grant ($2.5M), an MRFF Genomics Health Futures Mission ($1M), and a current 2024 MRFF Early to Mid-Career Researchers bid ($5M) led by the Garvan Institute.
- Developed novel approaches to improve ancient DNA research methods, and standards and conducted systematic benchmarks.
- Identified signatures of adaptation to coronaviruses in Southeast Asia, and identified potential candidates for drug repurposing, emphasising the utility of evolutionary analyses for medical research.

### 2016-2019: ARC Grant-Funded Researcher (A), The University of Adelaide
- Led an international multi-disciplinary team to study human adaptation immediately after the out-of-Africa migration. The team included population geneticists, bioinformaticians, medical genomicists, immunologists, and paleoclimate experts.
- Curated and managed the worldâ€™s first ancient human genome and microbiome database and applied it to perform one of the most comprehensive investigations of human evolution undertaken, as of 2018.
- The research resulted in two high-profile manuscripts published in Nature Ecology & Evolution and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.

### 2014-2015: Research and Teaching Assistant, Harvard University
- Supported primary instructors to develop course content.
- Set up the cloud-computing-based computational environment.
- Held office hours on behalf of the primary instructors.
- Taught the hands-on (practicum) sessions.

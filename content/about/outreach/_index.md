## Public Engagement

**Public events**: I have given talks about the significance of my work and engaged with the public through talks at Pint of Science and the Waterhouse Club. I have also supported Pint of Science events and Science Comedy shows at the Adelaide Fringe Festival 2025.

**Media engagement**: I have provided comments on my research output of interest and expert opinion on recent discoveries to written media outlets such as The New York Times, ABC Science, and CNN, national and regional Australian radio shows, and podcasts like NITV's "Take It Blak".

**History Teachers' Association of Australia (HTAA)**: I was invited to present at their National Conference in 2021, leading to ongoing collaborations to develop educational materials for secondary school curricula.

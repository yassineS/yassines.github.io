I am a research scholar of North African decent, born in Morocco with a mix of native Amazigh heritage. I currently work and live in Tarntanyangga on the banks of Karrawirra Parri in Kaurna country (Adelaide, South Australia). 

I am the Group Leader for Genomics and Bioinformatics at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD) at the University of Adelaide. As well as, an Evolutionary Medicine Research Fellow at the Black Ochre Data Labs (BODL), the Kids Research Institute Australia, and the Australian National University.

I have interdisciplinary research interests spanning Evolutionary Medicine, Genomics, Conservation Genomics, and Bioinformatics. Additionally, I contribute actively to capacity/capability building efforts, and public engagment through talks (e.g. Pint of Science, Adelaide Fring Festival), traditional media engagments (e.g. The New York Times, ABC Radio), and modern mediums such podcasts and [The Conversation articles](https://theconversation.com/profiles/yassine-souilmi-1243323/articles).

While I did most of my training in Morocco's Mohammed Vth Univeristy-Agdal, as a Fulbright scholar I was trained in bioinformatics and genomics at the Department for Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at Harvard University.

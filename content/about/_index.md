I am a research scholar of North African decent, born in Morocco with a mix of native Amazigh heritage. I currently work and live in Tarntanyangga on the banks of Karrawirra Parri in Kaurna country (Adelaide, South Australia). 

I am the Group Leader for Genomics and Bioinformatics at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD) at the University of Adelaide. As well as, an Evolutionary Medicine Research Fellow at the Black Ochre Data Labs (BODL), the Kids Research Institute Australia, and the Australian National University.

I have interdisciplinary research interests spanning Evolutionary Medicine, Genomics, Conservation Genomics, and Bioinformatics. Additionally, I contribute actively to capacity/capability building efforts, and public engagment through talks (e.g. Pint of Science, Adelaide Fring Festival), traditional media engagments (e.g. The New York Times, ABC Radio), and modern mediums such podcasts and [The Conversation articles](https://theconversation.com/profiles/yassine-souilmi-1243323/articles).

While I did most of my training in Morocco's Mohammed Vth Univeristy-Agdal, as a Fulbright scholar I was trained in bioinformatics and genomics at the Department for Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at Harvard University.

## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of medical and evolutionary genomics. I use both modern and ancient DNA to understand past events that have shaped genetic fitness and human health. My work focuses on:

- **Conservation Genomics**: Working primarily with dingoes, understanding their genomics background using ancient DNA, building detailed admixture maps, modeling the impact of human activity on dingo admixture, and developping methods to improve genetic testing.
- **Indigenous Genomics**: Working on genomic research with Indigenous populations, with careful attention to ethical considerations and community engagement.
- **Palaeo Population Genomics**: Applying state-of-the-art population and quantitative genetic techniques to ancient human genomes to build detailed portraits of human genetic adaptation through time.
- **Viral-Human Co-evolution**: Investigating how ancient viral epidemics have shaped human genetics, including my work on coronavirus-interacting genes more than 20,000 years ago in East Asia.
- **Bioinformatics and Computational Methods**: Developing reproducible bioinformatics workflows for genomic analysis, particularly for ancient DNA and across heterogeneous computing environments.

## Selected Publications

My research has been published in prestigious journals including Science, Current Biology, Nature Ecology & Evolution, and PNAS:

## Capacity Building and Teaching

I am actively involved in teaching and collaborative research in genomics education. Recently, I co-presented "Genomics Our Way: An Introduction to Genomics Research with Indigenous Australians" as part of the Genomics Education Network Australasia (GENA).

## Contact

I welcome collaboration opportunities in evolutionary genomics, ancient DNA analysis, and bioinformatics. Feel free to reach out via email for potential research collaborations or speaking engagements.

I am a research scholar of North African decent, born in Morocco with a mix of native Amazigh heritage. I currently work and live in Tarntanyangga on the banks of Karrawirra Parri in Kaurna country (Adelaide, South Australia). 

I am a Fulbright scholar with primary research focus on Evolutionary Medicine, Genomics, Conservation Genomics, and Bioinformatics. I am the Group Leader for Genomics and Bioinformatics at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD) at the University of Adelaide. As well as, an Evolutionary Medicine Research Fellow at the Black Ochre Data Labs (BODL), the Kids Research Institute Australia, and the Australian National University.

## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of medical and evolutionary genomics. I use both modern and ancient DNA to understand past events that have shaped genetic fitness and human health. My work focuses on:

- **Palaeo Population Genomics**: Applying state-of-the-art population and quantitative genetic techniques to ancient human genomes to build detailed portraits of human genetic adaptation through time.
- **Viral-Human Co-evolution**: Investigating how ancient viral epidemics have shaped human genetics, including my work on coronavirus-interacting genes more than 20,000 years ago in East Asia.
- **Bioinformatics and Computational Methods**: Developing reproducible bioinformatics workflows for genomic analysis, particularly for ancient DNA and across heterogeneous computing environments.
- **Indigenous Genomics**: Working on genomic research with Indigenous populations, with careful attention to ethical considerations and community engagement.

## Academic Background

Prior to joining ACAD, I was trained as a bioinformatics researcher at the Department for Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at Harvard University. I am a Fulbright alumnus and have played a significant leadership role in coordinating bioinformatics training and networks in Africa.

## Current Projects

I lead an international team of researchers working on the Online Ancient Genome Repository (OAGR)â€”a comprehensive centralized database containing all known ancient DNA specimens, genomes, and associated metadata. Through this project, we use ancient DNA to uncover the genetic signatures of human adaptation to significant environmental and socio-cultural changes over the last 20,000 years in Eurasia.

Other notable projects include:

- Investigating the role of genetic selection and climatic factors in the dispersal of anatomically modern humans out of Africa
- Analyzing how admixture has obscured signals of historical hard sweeps in humans
- Developing and benchmarking methods for ancient DNA analysis
- Contributing to the development of human reference pangenomes

## Selected Publications

## Teaching and Collaboration

I am actively involved in teaching and collaborative research in genomics education. Recently, I co-presented "Genomics Our Way: An Introduction to Genomics Research with Indigenous Australians" as part of the Genomics Education Network Australasia (GENA).

## Contact

I welcome collaboration opportunities in evolutionary genomics, ancient DNA analysis, and bioinformatics. Feel free to reach out via email for potential research collaborations or speaking engagements.

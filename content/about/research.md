My research sits at the intersection of medical and evolutionary genomics. I use both modern and ancient DNA to understand past events that have shaped genetic fitness and human health. My work focuses on:

- **Conservation Genomics**: Working primarily with dingoes, understanding their genomics background using ancient DNA, building detailed admixture maps, modeling the impact of human activity on dingo admixture, and developping methods to improve genetic testing.
- **Indigenous Genomics**: Working on genomic research with Indigenous populations, with careful attention to ethical considerations and community engagement.
- **Palaeo Population Genomics**: Applying state-of-the-art population and quantitative genetic techniques to ancient human genomes to build detailed portraits of human genetic adaptation through time.
- **Viral-Human Co-evolution**: Investigating how ancient viral epidemics have shaped human genetics, including my work on coronavirus-interacting genes more than 20,000 years ago in East Asia.
- **Bioinformatics and Computational Methods**: Developing reproducible bioinformatics workflows for genomic analysis, particularly for ancient DNA and across heterogeneous computing environments.
